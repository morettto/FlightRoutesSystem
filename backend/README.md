# Backend Project - Airports and Routes API

This is the backend for an API developed in .NET that exposes two main controllers:
- **Route**: Manages routes between airports.
- **Airport**: Manages information about airports.

The API is designed to run locally on HTTPS port 5001 and provides interactive documentation via Swagger.

## Technologies Used
- **.NET Core**
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Swagger** for API documentation

## Requirements

- .NET SDK 5.0 (my current development environment requires VS 2019, which supports up to .NET 5)

## Running the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/morettto/FlightRoutesSystem.git

2. Navigate to the backend project directory

   ```bash
    cd /backend

3. Execute project:

    ```bash
    dotnet run

The API will be available at the following URL:

Base URL: https://localhost:5001
